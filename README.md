# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : Import numpy module from python library as np
### Step 2: Define the marix using np.array([[],[],[]]) as "a"
### Step 3: Find the inverse of the matrix by np.linalg.inv(a) and store the value as "b"
### Step 4: Display the solution by using print function.

## Program:
```
import numpy as np
a=np.array([[1,0,3],[-1,2,-2],[2,3,-1]])
b=np.linalg.inv(a)
print(b)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
